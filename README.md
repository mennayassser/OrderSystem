# .NET Web API with RabbitMQ and SignalR
This project demonstrates a backend microservice architecture built using **ASP.NET Core Web API**, with **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous messaging and **SignalR** for real-time communication. The system integrates with a **WinForms desktop client**, allowing users to place and monitor orders through a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Place orders via a desktop application that interacts with the backend system
- Real-time order streaming using **SignalR**
- Asynchronous messaging with **RabbitMQ**
- **Entity Framework Core** for database interactions
- **Dockerized** environment using containers for Web API and SQL Server
- Clean separation of concerns between models, services, and data layers
- follows **Clean Architecture** principles for scalability and maintainability
- Modularized into microservices
- Added **JWT-based authentication**
- Includes ERD Showcasing database relations

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **RESTful APIs**
- **RabbitMQ**
- **SignalR**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **SQL Server**
- **WinForms (C#)**

## Future Work
- Implement role-based access control  
- Implement **Redis caching** for performance optimization
- Create UML for complete work
